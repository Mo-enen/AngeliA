Japan developed a feudal system of government under the shoguns, or military rulers, from the 12th to the 19th centuries CE. The most famous shogun was Tokugawa Ieyasu, who unified Japan and established the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603.
Japan opened up to the world and modernized after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, which ended the shogunate and restored the emperor's power. Japan became an imperialist power and fought in several wars, including the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War II.

Japan was defeated in World War II and occupied by the United States from 1945 to 1952, during which it adopted a new constitution and a democratic system of government. Japan experienced rapid economic growth and became a global leader in technology, industry, and culture in the post-war era.
