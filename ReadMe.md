A 2D game engine focused on open-world platformer games, built with C#.

## Features

- **Seamless Playtesting**: Test your game in real time while editing the map using the most advanced map editor available. The engine supports open-world-style maps without boundaries.
- **Integrated Game Window**: Run your game directly within the engine. No need to launch a separate window every time.
- **Built-in Pixel Art Editor**: A dedicated pixel art editor designed for creating and managing sprite sheets. Supports importing assets from Aseprite.
- **PC-Only**: Currently, the engine and the games it produces are PC only. The implementation is based on Raylib. It is possible to support other platforms by making more implementation of the AngeliA.Game class.
