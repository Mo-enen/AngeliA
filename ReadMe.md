2d game engine that focus on open world platformer games in C#.

## Key Features
- Play test anytime while editing map with the best map editor in the world. The map it creates is in open-world style without boundary. You can paint blocks from your own coded entities and pixel art. 
- Your game can run in the engine window. No need to open a new window every time.
- The engine provides a built-in pixel art editor that designed for paint and manage sprite sheet for game. Support import from Aseprite.
- Both the engine and the game it creates is PC only. I only made a Raylib-based implementation at this point. It's possible to support other platforms by making new implementations of the AngeliA.Game class.
